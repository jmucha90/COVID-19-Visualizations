# COVID-19-Visualizations

This repository is used to generate various visualizations to display various metrics relating to the spread of COVID-19.

Metrics include: 
- Total new cases
- New cases each day
- Total deaths
- Cases per 100,000 people
- Mortality rates

All line charts are generated using Python's plotly package. 

The source of the data used can be found on the [ECDC's Website](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/download-todays-data-geographic-distribution-covid-19-cases-worldwide)

The .py file will automatically download the .csv version of the most recent data and generate graphs from it.
